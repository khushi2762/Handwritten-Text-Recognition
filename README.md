# HANDWRITTEN TEXT RECOGNITION
The goal is to create a model which can recognize the digits, it can be extended to letters and an individual's handwriting. The major goal of the proposed system is understanding Convolutional Neural Network, and applying it to the handwritten recognition system.

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle. 
Link-> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format

The dataset contains 26 folders (A-Z) containing handwritten images in size 2828 pixels, each alphabet in the image is centre fitted to 2020 pixel box.

## LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORK USED:
Below are the prerequisites for this project:
1. Python (3.7.4 used)
2. IDE (Jupyter used)
3. Required frameworks are
4. Numpy (version 1.16.5)
5. cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
6. Keras (version 2.3.1)
7. Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
8. Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)
9. Pandas (version 0.25.1)

## Conclusion:
Implemented the recognition of single characters with an accuracy of 97%.
